# üß± Microservices System Architecture (Java + React)

This project consists of multiple microservices built using **Java Spring Boot**, **ReactJS**, and **Terraform**. Each service is developed and versioned in its own GitHub repository, but they can be organized locally in this folder structure for ease of development and deployment.

## üì¶ Services

|No.| Repo Name                   | Description                                      |

| 1 | `spring-gateway`            | API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)               |
| 2 | `spring-discovery`          | Eureka Discovery Server                          |

## üîß How to Set Up Locally

1. Clone this folder structure
2. Clone each repo inside it
3. Run services individually
