# üß± Microservices System Architecture (Java + React)

This project consists of multiple microservices built using **Java Spring Boot**, **ReactJS**, and **Terraform**. Each service is developed and versioned in its own GitHub repository, but they can be organized locally in this folder structure for ease of development and deployment.

## üì¶ Services

| Repo Name                    | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `spring-gateway`            | API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)              |
| `spring-discovery`          | Eureka Discovery Server                          |
| `spring-grpc-user-service`  | User Service with REST + gRPC, MongoDB           |
| `spring-grpc-stock-service` | Stock Service with REST + gRPC, MongoDB          |
| `spring-grpc-meet-service`  | Real-time Meet Service with WebSocket            |
| `stock-portal-frontend`     | Frontend in ReactJS                              |
| `jitsi-deployment`          | Jitsi Meet setup (standalone)                    |
| `keycloak-auth-server`      | Identity provider using Keycloak + PostgreSQL    |
| `infra`                     | Terraform/Terragrunt scripts for AWS deployment  |

## üîß How to Set Up Locally

1. Clone this folder structure
2. Clone each repo inside it
3. Run with Docker Compose or run services individually
